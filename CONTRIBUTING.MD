============

* Use appropriate formatting
    * Java
        * 4 Spaces (No tabs PLEASE)
        * Brackets on the same line
        * Space between all keywords, operators and values
        * Long lines are OK - do not break long lines unless there is a logical, tabular break pattern (for example initialising elements in a long array) or if Vanilla does so
        * Generally you should explicitly use `this`.
        * Generally you should use braces { } following `if ()` and `for ()` statements, even if it is only one line.
        * Interfaces - do not put the prefix 'I' on the file name (example `Rotatable`, not `IRotatable`)
        * For everyone's sake _**PLEASE**_ use `@Override`.
        * JSON
            * 2 Spaces indent (NO TABS)
            * Keep arrays on the same line (do not wrap)
            * Spaces after `,` and `:`
* Name all variables correctly
